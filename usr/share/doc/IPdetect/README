IPdetect
version: 0.5b (beta) (02.Sep.2005)
(c) Mariusz Kaczmarczyk <koshmar@poczta.fm>

IP change detection script.
IPdetect should be run with Cron (or other task scheduler) every minute, to
detect IP changes. It detects 'public' IP of your connection and if change
is detected it runs scripts. It works behind NAT as well. You may use it
(for sample) when you have xDSL connection with variable IP, and you want
to provide some hosting functionality. Scripts run on change should then
update your DNS name to your current IP address.
IPdetect was tested on Debian GNU/Linux with freedns.afraid.org and
'curl --silent <update_URL>' command, and it worked OK.

REQUIREMENTS:
- modern version of UNIX-like OS with Bash (should work with any POSIX
compliant shell, but not tested)
- wget or cURL
- Cron or other task scheduler
- dnsutils (for host based detection)
- internet connection :-)

FILES:
/etc/IPdetect/IPdetect.conf - main configuration file, it's well commented.
Setup it before running IPdetect.
/etc/IPdetect/change_run.sh - this script is run when IP change is
detected. It should contain update commands. It must have executable
attribute set. Protect this file from unauthorized read/run, set access
mode to 700 (as it may contain update URLs or DNS services passwords etc.).
/etc/IPdetect/ip_sources - place sites providing your public IP here. It
doesn't need to be ONLY your IP, but less junk is better. :-) Some working
sites included.
/var/lib/IPdetect/last_detect - automatically created storage file for
results of last execution, like last IP, IP detection time, IP update time.
Modyfying this file may lead to net abuses!
/var/log/IPdetect/IPdetect.log - log file. More about its format soon.

ERRORS:
On exit IPdetect can return one of the following codes:
0 - No error (include notices)
1 - Cannot locate config file
2 - Bad STORE_DIR, must be existing directory with read & write privileges
3 - Bad IP_RETRIEVE_METHOD, must be one of: 'wget', 'curl'
4 - No web source returned valid IP number
5 - Bad IP_COMPARE_METHOD, should be one of: 'last', 'host'
6 - Cannot resolve domain from CHECK_DOMAIN
7 - Cannot execute change_run.sh script
8 - CHECK_DOMAIN cannot be empty when IP_COMPARE_METHOD is 'host'
9 - Cannot write to temporary directory

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:
-h (--help) - short help message
-f (--force-update) - force running of change_run.sh script

INSTALLATION:
1. Copy all files from archive to your filesystem, preserving paths
and permissions
2. Edit /etc/IPdetect/IPdetect.conf file and setup desired configuration
3. Add your IP source URL to /etc/IPdetect/ip_sources or use shipped default
4. Edit /etc/IPdetect/change_run.sh and add your update commands here
5. Restart Cron (crontab file shipped with program should add suitable task)
